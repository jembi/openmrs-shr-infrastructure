OpenMRS Shared Health Record Infrastructure
===========================================

Infrastructure scripts for setting up an OpenHIE-based Shared Health Record using OpenMRS.

Usage
-----
To run an instance of the SHR, first ensure that [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is setup on your system and then simply run `vagrant up`, e.g.
```
git clone https://github.com/jembi/openmrs-shr-infrastructure.git
cd openmrs-shr-infrastructure
vagrant up
```
After launching, the SHR will be available on `http://localhost:8082/openmrs`. The default login is `admin` using the password `OpenMRS123`.
